## Projects

### Project 1: Netflix Data Exploration and Visualisation

This project delves into Netflix's vast content library to identify key trends, understand viewer preferences, and uncover regional insights. By analyzing various factors like content type, release year, country of origin, and ratings, I aim to provide data-driven recommendations that can help Netflix optimize its content acquisition and distribution strategies.

* **Key Technologies:** Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Collab
* **Key Insights/Results:** The analysis explores content distribution patterns, identifies top-performing countries for different content types, and examines release patterns over time. Specific insights include identifying peak release periods, popular directors and actors in different regions, common movie ratings, and trends in content duration.  *(These insights are based on the PDF you provided.  Make sure to update them with your own findings.)*


### Project 2: Target Brazil E-Commerce Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of over 100,000 orders from Target Brazil's e-commerce platform between 2016 and 2018. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and SQL (BigQuery), I uncover valuable insights into customer behavior, order trends, and regional sales distributions. The analysis covers various aspects of the business, including payment methods, freight costs, delivery times, and seasonal patterns.

* **Key Technologies:** SQL, BigQuery
* **Key Insights/Results:** The analysis identifies trends in customer behavior, order volumes, and regional sales distributions. It also provides insights into payment method preferences, the impact of freight costs on purchasing decisions, delivery time performance, and the influence of seasonality on sales patterns. *(These insights are based on the PDF you provided.  Make sure to update them with your own findings.)*
